The lab contains many funtions. While I was doing the lab, I have found many
compromises. If time is enough, I can do better.
1. my code only supports two level dimensions. the second level is not 
    funtioning well enough. There often happens gliches inclinding 
    segment fault.
2. Three funtion which are the last three are not done. 
    1. for the fs_get_filesize, my basic idea is, I will find the 
        location of the fildes, then read the blocks it has used.
    2. for the fs_lseek(), when doing append, I will assign a new block to
        simulate the action of appending. For other actions, I will thy to 
        read the block containing the offeset. Then, split the content according
        to the offeset;
    3. for the fs_truncate(), I will get the size of the file first, then 
        if the new size is larger, then nothing changes, otherwise, I will
        re-write the file with the new length.
3. My FAT table is actually not large enough because I have fixed size of blocks
    for the table. If I change it, there will be huge of lines needed to be chagned.
4. Due to imcompleting funciton, I do not have the ability to test to see if the file exits
    if I re-open it.
